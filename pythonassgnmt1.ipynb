        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.Python is widely used in various fields, including data science, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), automation, and cybersecurity.\n",
        "    ->Python is easy to learn because its syntax is simple and feels like English.A massive community supports it with tons of ready-to-use libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Django, making development faster.\n",
        "2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Interpreter translates high-level Python code into machine-readable instructions at runtime.An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line instead of compiling the entire program at once (like C or Java compilers do).\n",
        "3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python there are certain words which cannot be used as variable names,function names and identifiers because they are python keywords which have special meaning These keywords help define the structure and syntax of Python programs.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    ->examples of python keywords: if, elif, else, match, case,\tfor, while, break, continue, def, return, yield, lambda, def, True, False, None and many more.\n",
        "4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "\n",
        "    No, Python keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have predefined meanings and are reserved for specific purposes in the language.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Mutability in python means whether the value of the object can be changed or not after the creation of the object.\n",
        "    ->List,Dictionary,Set are mutable objects in Python.\n",
        "6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "    List store references to elements, meaning their contents can change.whereas tuples store fixed values, so their contents cannot change.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    In Python, ==(Equality) and is(Identity) are both used for comparisons, but they work differently. == compares values of 2 objects whereas is checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and return True or False based on conditions.The logical operators in Python are and,or,not. and,returns True if both conditions are True.or,returns True if at least one condition is True.not, reverses the result (True becomes False, and vice versa).\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "\n",
        "    Implicit Type Casting is automatic conversion of one data type to another  by Python.There is risk of data loss in Implicit type casting.whereas in Explicit Type Casting there is manual conversion of one data type to another by the programmer and there is risk of data loss.\n",
        "11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "     \n",
        "    Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. They help control the flow of execution by executing different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is True or False.we use conditional statments for desicion making that is to run different code based on condition.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "\n",
        "    The elif statement is used when you need to check multiple conditions in a sequence. these work when there are multiple if statements but stops checking once a condition is True.these elif statement is more efficient than using multiple if statements separately.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loop?\n",
        "\n",
        "    for  loop is used when the number of iterations are known, whereas while loop is used when the iterations are unknown.for loop iterates over a sequence where as while loop runs as long as the condition is true.There is a risk of infinite loop in the while loop when the condition never becomes False.\n",
        "14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "    The best scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop is building a login system that keeps asking for the correct password until the user enters it correctly. Here, we don't know how many attempts the user will take, so a while loop is the best choice.The loop keeps running until the user enters the correct password.If the user enters the correct password on the first try, the loop runs only once.If they keep entering the wrong password, the loop continues indefinitely until they enter the correct one.A for loop is not ideal here because we don’t know how many times the user will need to enter the password.If we set a for loop with a fixed number of attempts, the user might still want more chances\n",
